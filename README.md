This repo tracks my work in the Context-Engineering cohort—a hands-on study group focused on building grounded, reproducible NLP workflows. 
Each piece is a small, classroom-style lab: minimal preprocessing, transparent hyperparameters, quick sanity checks, and short takeaways. 
I’m using the cohort to practice representation learning (Word2Vec, FastText etc), lightweight document embeddings, and simple similarity probes that tie back to real prompts 
and tasks.

This repo contains the following models:
I’ll keep adding small, reproducible notebooks as the cohort progresses:

Word2Vec (CBOW)
FastText
